# Git Gui App
Git GUI App is a third-party Git interface that allows developers to work seamlessly with all three major Git platforms â€” GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab.

Unlike many Linux Git GUI tools that primarily support public repositories and basic operations (pull, push, etc.), Git GUI App fully supports private repositories as well.

This project is currently under active development and scaling, and we welcome contributions from the open-source community. If youâ€™d like to help make this application better, feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
